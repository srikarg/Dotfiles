  paging:
    # Value of the --color arg in the git diff command. Some pagers want this to be set to 'always' and some want it set to 'never'
    colorArg: always
    # e.g.
    # diff-so-fancy
    # delta --dark --paging=never
    # ydiff -p cat -s --wrap --width={{columnWidth}}
    pager: delta --dark --paging=never
    # If true, Lazygit will use whatever pager is specified in `$GIT_PAGER`, `$PAGER`, or your *git config*. If the pager ends with something like ` | less` we will strip that part out, because less doesn't play nice with our rendering approach. If the custom pager uses less under the hood, that will also break rendering (hence the `--paging=never` flag for the `delta` pager).
